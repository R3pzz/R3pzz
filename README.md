My name is Kuzma Shpak, currently a 8-grader, live in Kiev, Ukraine. My passion is
software dev, especially in c or c++. I also have my own NFT collection, Star Snails.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own game engine and an entity component system [ECS].
- 🐊 Also I have my own NFT collection, which you can check out here: https://starsnailsnft.com/.
- 🏀 I'm keen on basketball, especially streetball. Have played basketball for nearly 4 years.

🤗 Hope you'll check my repo's and help me in engine dev!
